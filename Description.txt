Building a database, even a simple one, is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of computer science, distributed systems, and database internals. While it is certainly possible to build a database using Golang, it is not a trivial task, and it requires a lot of time and effort.

Here are some high-level steps you could take to build a simple database using Golang:

Define the data model
The first step in building a database is to define the data model, i.e., the structure of the data you want to store. This could be as simple as key-value pairs, or as complex as a document store like MongoDB. You'll need to think about how your data will be stored on disk and how it will be accessed.

Write the storage engine
The storage engine is the component of the database that is responsible for reading and writing data to disk. In a simple database, you might choose to store data in a flat file or a key-value store like RocksDB. Golang provides several useful libraries for working with storage, including the standard library's os and bufio packages.

Build the query engine
The query engine is responsible for parsing and executing queries against the database. This could involve implementing a query language like SQL, or it could be as simple as providing a set of functions for retrieving and filtering data. You'll need to think about how queries will be executed efficiently, especially if you expect your database to grow to a large size.

Add concurrency control
Concurrency control is crucial in a database to ensure that multiple users can access the same data at the same time without corrupting it. This could involve implementing locking mechanisms like mutexes or semaphores, or it could involve more advanced techniques like optimistic concurrency control.

Implement indexing and searching
To make it easy for users to find the data they're looking for, you'll need to implement indexing and searching. This could involve building an index on a particular field in your data, or it could involve implementing a full-text search engine.

Write tests and benchmarks
Testing and benchmarking are essential components of building a database. You'll need to write tests to ensure that your database is working as expected, and benchmarks to measure its performance under load.

These are just some high-level steps you could take to build a simple database using Golang. However, keep in mind that building a database is a significant undertaking, and it requires a lot of knowledge and experience in computer science, distributed systems, and database internals. It's not a task to be taken lightly, and it may be worth considering using an existing database system if your needs are relatively simple.
